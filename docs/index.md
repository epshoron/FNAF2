## Reading Order
1. Mechanics Whitepaper → core rules, timings, states
2. Enemy Dossiers → per-enemy behavior + tells
3. Toy Paths → stage map + inference rules
4. Changelog → what changed and why

## Documents
- [Mechanics Whitepaper](mechanics-whitepaper.md)
- [Enemy Dossiers](enemy-dossiers.md)
- [Toy Paths](toy-paths.md)
- [Changelog](changelog.md)

## Conventions
- **Terminology:** use consistent names for rooms/cameras/states.
- **Assumptions:** write them explicitly (what is known vs inferred).
- **Evidence tag:** when you claim something, mark source:
  - `OBSERVED:` from gameplay footage / frame reading
  - `INFERRED:` derived logic
  - `UNKNOWN:` not confirmed yet

## Current Priorities
- [ ] Define global game loop / tick timing
- [ ] List all enemies + unique mechanics
- [ ] Draft initial path graphs for each toy
- [ ] Log every change in changelog
