# Mechanics Whitepaper

> Goal: Define the rules in a way that is implementable (states, timings, transitions).

## Sections
- [01 Overview](mechanics/01-overview.md)
- [02 Timing & Update Loop](mechanics/02-timing.md)
- [03 Player Actions](mechanics/03-player-actions.md)
- [04 State Machine](mechanics/04-state-machine.md)

## Evidence Tags
- `OBSERVED:` from footage / frame reading
- `INFERRED:` derived from logic
- `UNKNOWN:` not confirmed yet

## Naming Rules
- Use consistent camera/room names.
- One claim per bullet. If a claim is uncertain, tag it `UNKNOWN:`.
